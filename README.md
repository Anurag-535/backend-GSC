Now, let me explain the key aspects of this backend implementation:
Architecture and Features

Modular Structure: Organized into models, controllers, routes, and middleware
User Authentication with JWT
Donation Management with Geospatial Indexing
Security Middleware (Helmet, CORS)
Error Handling
Environment Configuration

Key Improvements

Secure password hashing
JWT-based authentication
Geospatial donation tracking
Robust error handling
Scalable architecture

Next Steps for Google Solution Challenge

Implement advanced search and filter capabilities
Add machine learning for food waste prediction
Create dashboard for impact tracking
Integrate with Google Maps API for enhanced location services

Recommended Enhancements

Add email verification
Implement rate limiting
Create more comprehensive validation
Add logging mechanism

To integrate with your existing frontend:

Update frontend fetch/axios calls to use new API endpoints
Handle JWT token in frontend storage (localStorage/sessionStorage)
Add interceptors for token management

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of the backend implementation or discuss integration strategies with your frontend?
